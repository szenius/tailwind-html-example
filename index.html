            Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest
            to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the
            shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god
            Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and
            mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god
            Hermes (Ἑρμῆς).

            Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman
            goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object in
            Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be,
            on rare occasions, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus
            lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far from
            the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the
            east a little while before dawn.

            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
            object known to harbour and support life. About 29.2% of Earth's
            surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining
            70.8% is covered with water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and
            other salt-water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers, and other
            freshwater, which together constitute the hydrosphere.

            Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest
            planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In
            English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often
            referred to as the "Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of
            the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish
            appearance (as shown), that is distinctive among the astronomical
            bodies visible to the naked eye.

            Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the
            Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half
            times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined,
            but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter
            is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after
            the Moon and Venus. It has been observed since pre-historic times
            and is named after the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods,
            because of its observed size.

            Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in
            the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average
            radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It only has
            one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger
            volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named after
            the Roman god of wealth and agriculture. Its astronomical symbol (♄)
            has been traced back to the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri, where it can
            be seen to be a Greek kappa-rho with a cross-bar, as an abbreviation
            for Κρονος (Cronos), the Greek name for the planet. It later came to
            look like a lower-case Greek eta, with the cross added at the top in
            the 16th century.

            Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference
            to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who, according to Greek
            mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of
            Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the
            third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in
            the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and
            both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the
            larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn.

          <p class="leading-relaxed">
            Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun.
            In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter,
            the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is
            17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin
            Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because
            its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its
            atmosphere.
